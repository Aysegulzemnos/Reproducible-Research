######Steps in data analysis

1. define the question
2. define the ideal data set
3. determine what data you can access
4. obtain the data
- try to obtain the raw dat
- be sure to reference the source
- polite emails go a long way
- if you will load the data from an internet source, record the url and time accessed
5. clean the data
- raw data often needs to be processed
- if it is pre-processed, make sure you understand how
- understand the source of the data(census, sample, convenience sample)
- may need reformining, subsampling
- determine if the data are good enough

    > library(kernlab)
    > data(spam)
    > str(spam[,1:5])
6. explortory data analysis
7. statistical prediction/modeling
8. interpret results
9. challenge results
10. synthesize/write up results
11. create reproducible code
